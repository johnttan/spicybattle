##Purpose

Adventure Time Battle Party(ATBP) is a game produced by Cartoon Network(CN) that lacked a transparent system for reviewing and sharing gameplay statistics and personal records. 

This application uses Google Chrome Extensions and a web server to request data from a private CN API. The server aggregates data and allows players to view both their own statistics and those of others via the web app.
